# RANDOM-PASSWORD-GENERATOR-FOR-MICROIT
This is a simple web application that helps you create strong and secure passwords based on your own preferences. The project uses HTML and CSS for the frontend and Python (Flask) on the backend. When you click the "Generate Password" button, it sends your choices to the backend, which creates a random password and shows it on the screen.
